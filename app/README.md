# TikoPardy

TikoPardy is a Jeopardy-style game that uses terminology and definitions from the courses studied during the first year of the Information and Communication Technology program at JAMK University of Applied Sciences. The game provides a definition, and the player must choose from four options the correct term that matches the given definition.

## Description

In the TikoPardy game, you can test your knowledge across five courses: Web Basics, Programming Basics, Operating Systems and Servers, Introduction to Information Security, and Introduction to Cloud Services. In the standard game mode, you have three lives. You lose one life for each incorrect answer. The game ends when you run out of lives or when youâ€™ve answered all the words from the selected course.

You can track how many correct answers youâ€™ve given in a row and how many points youâ€™ve earned. The game saves your highest score for each course. For an extra challenge, you can enable the Timer setting. Thereâ€™s also a Sudden Death mode, where you only have one life. You can also practice the vocabulary using the Practice mode. In Practice mode, you have unlimited lives, but you wonâ€™t earn any points.
